# Getting started
This document is a short overview on how to get a BIT4 board working.

## Hardware:
First you'll need a BIT4 PCB. The gerber files for this are in
the /hardware/v1.0 folder.
\
A list of all components (BOM) is also in the /hardware/v1.0 folder.
\
Additionally you need a rechargeable LIR2032 cell battery to power the board.
\
**!IMPORTANT!** If you use a non-rechargeable CR2032 cell battery, do not place the charging circuit (IC2, C4, C5, R4, R2, LED2).


## Firmware:

The idea for this project came from the german microcontroller learning plattform "TPS" (http://elektronik-labor.de/Lernpakete/TPS/TPS0.html).
